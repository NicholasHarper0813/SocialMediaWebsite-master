## SocialMediaWebsite

Social networks constitute the greatest global information platform on the internet
today. They have become an indispensable part of our daily lives, As people
spend more time socializing on the internet.
The web project simulates asocial media website called “Truffle” where the users can create, 
edit and update their profiles with a strong authentication system provided inbuilt 
by the Django framework. The logged in users can add, edit , download and delete posts,
search users, like and comment on the post as well as follow/unfollow other
users. The website hosts a user suggestion section where random users are
displayed on refreshing the page.
This project report will introduce how to build a social media web application
system using the Django framework. Django is an open-source web application
framework written in python. This social media web application system built using
Django has five major components with different functionalities that will be
introduced later. We will introduce various features of the Django framework and
SQLite3 RDBMS in the later section. In the end, snapshots are attached to
